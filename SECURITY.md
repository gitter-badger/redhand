## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find problems with the security please create a Security Advisory or create an issue and explain the problem to the best of your abilities.
I will try to fix the problem ASAP however it might take a few days to get the problem fixed.

To create a Security Advisory click on the security tab on github, select `Security Advisories` and click on the `new draft security advisory`.
Fill out all of the fields and I will try to solve the problem (or you can even do that yourself if you have the knowledge).
